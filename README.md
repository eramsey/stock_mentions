# stock_mentions

Not going to sugar coat things... this script/app is in its infancy right now... it gets the job done but is in no way complete.

## pre-reqs
- Ruby 2.6.1
- I recommend RVM

## install
```
bundle
vi config/config.yaml
```
- there is an example config in config/config.example

## run
```
./stock
```
